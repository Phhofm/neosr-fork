# --- Core Dependencies ---
# These are required to load the model architecture and export it.
torch>=2.7.1  # Core PyTorch library for the model and export functionality.
torchvision>=0.22.1 # PyTorch's vision library for image manipulation (e.g., loading and processing test images).
torchmetrics>=1.3.2 # For calculating quality metrics like PSNR and SSIM during validation.
numpy>=2.0.0    # Fundamental package for numerical operations.
onnx>=1.16.0    # The ONNX library for exporting the model to the ONNX format.

# --- ONNX Runtime for Validation ---
# These are optional but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for verifying the exported ONNX models.
# The export script uses ONNX Runtime to perform a validation pass on the exported
# files to ensure they are converted correctly and produce the same output as
# the original PyTorch model. Without this, the validation check will fail.

# For NVIDIA GPUs:
# This version is built with CUDA 12.x and is compatible with your environment.
# Ensure your NVIDIA driver is up-to-date (R570+) and supports CUDA 12.8 or newer.
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.21.0

# For AMD/Intel GPUs (DirectML on Windows):
# If you are on Windows with an AMD/Intel GPU, you can use this instead.
# Comment out the `onnxruntime-gpu` line and uncomment the line below.
# onnxruntime-directml>=1.21.0

# For CPU-only inference:
# If you don't have a GPU, you can use this version.
# Comment out the GPU/DML lines and uncomment the line below.
# onnxruntime>=1.21.0
